This is a MATLAB/C implementation of the SIFT detector and descriptor
[1]. See the documentation in 'doc/' to get started.

COMPLING
  From MATLAB prompt
  > sift_compile
  From shell prompt (Linux, Mac OS X)
  > make

TESTING
  > sift_demo
  > sift_demo2
  > sift_demo3

ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE
  We use the follwing convention to name files:
  *.m *.c:       M and MEX files
  sift*mx.c:     `Private' MEX files 
  sift_*.m:      Service scripts (compiling, demos)

CHANGES

  0.9.7 Fixed a minor glitch in the convolution code. Increased the
        default number of octaves that get computed (this is more
        similar to Lowe's version).
  0.9.6 Modified the convolution code to handle image boundaries more
        similarly to Lowe's version.
  0.9.5 Fixed a minor issues with the new sift_demo3.m.
  0.9.4 Fixed another bug in the detection of keypoints close to
        the boundary. Reduced the size of the distribution. New test code.
  0.9.3 Improved plotmatches.m and tightsubplot.m
  0.9.2 Improved detection of keypoints too close to the boundary
  0.9.1 Fixed a bug in the creation of the .zip archive
  0.9   Fixed a bug for which some of the keypoint detected where
        dropped.
