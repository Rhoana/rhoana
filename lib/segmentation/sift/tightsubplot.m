function H = tightsubplot(varargin)
% TIGHTSUBPLOT  Tiles axes without wasting space
%   H = TIGHTSUBPLOT(K,P) returns an handle to the P-th axis in a
%   regular grid of K axes. The K axes are numbered from left to right
%   and from top to bottom.  The function operates similarly to
%   SUBPLOT(), but by default it does not put any margin between axes.
%
%   H = TIGHTSUBPLOT(M,N,P) retursn an handle to the P-th axes in a
%   regular subdivision with M rows and N columns.
%
%   The function accepts the following option-value pairs:
%
%   'Spacing' [0]
%     Set extra spacing between axes.  The space is added between the
%     inner or outer boxes, depending on the setting below.
%
%   'Box' ['inner'] (** ONLY >R14 **)
%     If set to 'outer', the function displaces the axes by their
%     outer box, thus protecting title and labels. Unfortunately
%     MATLAB typically picks unnecessarily large insets, so that a bit
%     of space is wasted in this case.  If set to 'inner', the
%     function uses the inner box. This causes the instets of nearby
%     axes to overlap, but it is very space conservative.
%
%   REMARK. While SUBPLOT kills any pre-existing axes that overalps a
%   new one, this function does not.
%
