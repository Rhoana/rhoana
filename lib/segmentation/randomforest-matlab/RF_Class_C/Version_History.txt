svn-v4

Added a `cruft' conditional compile for win64 (-DWIN64) target which involves exporting (extern)
fortran and c function names with another _ at the start (there was one at the end already)

CROSS-compiling target for win64 shown in the makefile target for rfsub

Reasons for crosscompiling lies with cygwin not supporting generation of 32 bit binaries.

right now the rfsub.o is directly taken from the precompiled_rfsub directory for
windows systems, that is the compiled_windows.m directly uses the precompiled
rfsub.o to generate based on the current windows version (tested on winxp 64 and 32). 
Its hard to set up the required software (gfortran/g77) on cygwin
(which also are available only to generate 32 bit binaries). 

for windows based rfsub.o. crosscompiler from mingw64 was used on linux from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202880&package_id=245516&release_id=546049

for linux, its simpler to set up gfortran and gcc so will depend on recompiling
everytime mex is recompiled. Checked on 32 and 64 bit linux.
